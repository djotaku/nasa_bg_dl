			<description>An Atlas-Centaur launched at 5:22 p.m. EST on March 27, 1969, to send Mariner 7 on its way to Mars. Mariner 7 joined its sister spacecraft, Mariner 6, on a journey that carried them within 2,000 miles of the red planet that summer. Mariner 6 was launched from Kennedy Space Center in Florida on Feb. 24 and investigated the Martian equatorial area while Mariner 7 concentrated on the south polar cap.</description>

			<title>Sending “Water” to Europa</title>
			<link>https://www.nasa.gov/image-detail/pia26063orig/</link>
			<description>NASA&#039;s Europa Clipper spacecraft will carry a special message when it launches in October 2024 and heads toward Jupiter&#039;s moon Europa. The moon shows strong evidence of an ocean under its icy crust, with more than twice the amount of water of all of Earth&#039;s oceans combined. A triangular metal plate, seen here, will honor that connection to Earth.&#013;&#010;&#013;&#010;The plate is made of tantalum metal and is about 7 by 11 inches (18 by 28 centimeters). It is engraved on both sides and seals an opening in the electronics vault, which houses the spacecraft&#039;s sensitive electronics. The art on this side of the plate features waveforms that are visual representations of the sound waves formed by the word &#034;water&#034; in 103 languages. The waveforms radiate out from a symbol representing the American Sign Language sign for &#034;water.&#034;</description>

			<title>Hubble Views a Galaxy Under Pressure</title>
			<link>https://www.nasa.gov/image-detail/hubble-views-a-galaxy-under-pressure/</link>
			<description>This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image shows LEDA 42160, a galaxy about 52 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Virgo. The dwarf galaxy is one of many forcing its way through the comparatively dense gas in the massive Virgo cluster of galaxies. The pressure exerted by this intergalactic gas, known as ram pressure, has dramatic effects on star formation in LEDA 42160.</description>

			<title>Martian Barchan Dunes</title>
			<link>https://www.nasa.gov/image-detail/pia23669orig/</link>
			<description>This image shows two types of sand dunes on Mars. The small dots are called barchan dunes, and from their shape we can tell that they are upwind. The downwind dunes are long and linear. These two types of dune each show the wind direction in different ways: the barchans have a steep slope and crescent-shaped &#034;horns&#034; that point downwind, while the linear dunes are stretched out along the primary wind direction. Linear dunes, however, typically indicate a wind regime with at least two different prevailing winds, which stretch out the sand along their average direction. In several places in this image, you can find barchan dunes turning into linear dunes as they are stretched out, but they both seem into indicate the same wind direction.</description>

			<title>Hubble Uncovers a Celestial Fossil</title>
			<link>https://www.nasa.gov/image-detail/hubble-uncovers-a-celestial-fossil/</link>
			<description>This densely populated group of stars is the globular cluster NGC 1841, which is part of the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way galaxy that lies about 162,000 light-years away. Satellite galaxies are bound by gravity in orbits around a more massive host galaxy. We typically think of the Andromeda Galaxy as our galaxy’s nearest galactic companion, but it is more accurate to say that Andromeda is the nearest galaxy that is not in orbit around the Milky Way galaxy. In fact, dozens of satellite galaxies orbit our galaxy and they are far closer than Andromeda. The largest and brightest of these is the LMC, which is easily visible to the unaided eye from the southern hemisphere under dark sky conditions away from light pollution.</description>

			<description>A female (left) and a male roseate spoonbill get together near the tall grasses at the edge of a pond in the Merritt Island National Wildlife Refuge, northwest of Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Spoonbills inhabit areas of mangrove such as on the coasts of southern Florida and Texas. These birds feed on shrimps and fish in the shallow water, sweeping their bills from side to side. This and other wildlife abound throughout Kennedy as it shares a boundary with the Wildlife Refuge, home to some of the nation’s rarest and most unusual species of wildlife. The wildlife refuge is a habitat for more than 310 species of birds, 25 mammals, 117 fishes and 65 amphibians and reptiles.</description>

			<description>Members of NASA’s Exploration Ground System’s Landing and Recovery team and partners from the Department of Defense aboard the USS San Diego practice recovery procedures during Underway Recovery Test 11 (URT-11) off the coast of San Diego on Thursday, Feb. 22, 2024. The team works to secure the Crew Module Test Article and align it on its stand inside the ship’s well deck. URT-11 is the eleventh in a series of Artemis recovery tests, and the first time NASA and its partners put their Artemis II recovery procedures to the test with the astronauts.</description>

			<title>Hubble Views an Active Star-Forming Galaxy</title>
			<link>https://www.nasa.gov/image-detail/a-high-amount-of-ram/</link>
			<description>This NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope image features IC 3476, a dwarf galaxy that lies about 54 million light-years from Earth in the constellation Coma Berenices. While this image does not look very dramatic – we might say it looks almost serene – the actual physical events taking place in IC 3476 are highly energetic. In fact, the little galaxy is undergoing a process called ram pressure stripping that is driving unusually high levels of star formation in regions of the galaxy.</description>

			<title>Studying Arctic Ice</title>
			<link>https://www.nasa.gov/image-detail/7348420132-79aab0d0d9-o/</link>
			<description>On July 12, 2011, crew from the U.S. Coast Guard Cutter Healy retrieved a canister dropped by parachute from a C-130, which brought supplies for some mid-mission fixes. The ICESCAPE, or &#034;Impacts of Climate on Ecosystems and Chemistry of the Arctic Pacific Environment, mission was a NASA shipborne investigation to study how changing conditions in the Arctic affect the ocean&#039;s chemistry and ecosystems. The bulk of the research took place in the Beaufort and Chukchi seas in summer 2010 and 2011.</description>

			<title>NASA’S OSIRIS-REx Curation Team Reveals Remaining Asteroid Sample</title>
			<link>https://www.nasa.gov/image-detail/osiris-rex-pe-examination-5/</link>
			<description>A top-down view of the OSIRIS-REx Touch-and-Go-Sample-Acquisition-Mechanism (TAGSAM) head with the lid removed, revealing the remainder of the asteroid sample inside. Erika Blumenfeld, creative lead for the Advanced Imaging and Visualization of Astromaterials (AIVA) and Joe Aebersold, project management lead, captured this picture using manual high-resolution precision photography and a semi-automated focus stacking procedure. The result is an image that can be zoomed in on to show extreme detail of the sample. The remaining sample material includes dust and rocks up to about .4 in (one cm) in size.</description>

			<title>30 Doradus B: NASA Telescopes Start the Year With a Double Bang</title>
			<link>https://www.nasa.gov/image-detail/30dorb/</link>
			<description>This deep dataset from Chandra of the remains of a supernova known as 30 Doradus B (30 Dor B) reveals evidence for more than one supernova explosion in the history of this remnant. Unusual structures in the Chandra data cannot be explained by a single explosion. These images of 30 Dor B also show optical data from the Blanco telescope in Chile, and infrared data from Spitzer. Additional data from Hubble highlights sharp features in the image.</description>

			<title>A &#034;Green Monster&#034; Lurks in Star&#039;s Debris</title>
			<link>https://www.nasa.gov/image-detail/casa-greenmonster-2/</link>
			<description>For the first time, astronomers have combined data from NASA’s Chandra X-ray Observatory and James Webb Space Telescope to study the well-known supernova remnant Cassiopeia A (Cas A). This work has helped explain an unusual structure in the debris from the destroyed star called the “Green Monster,” because of its resemblance to the wall in the left field of Fenway Park. </description>
