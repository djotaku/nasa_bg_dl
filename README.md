Downloads images from NASA background of the day

TODO
- use a JSON config file for where to save the file for the temp version
- use os.rename https://www.golangprograms.com/move-a-file-from-one-location-to-another-in-golang.html to move the file based on orientation
- use go routines to get all 3 images at once?
